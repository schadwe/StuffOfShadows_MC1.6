Fear Mechanism
==============
Fear rated from 0% to 100%.  Shown by bar/sphere/spiral in GUI.

Fear caused by:
- Darkness.  The darker the space, the more fear generated per second (20 tics). Fear gain as a percentage of light from max 15 units.
- Damage by hostile mobs.
- Looking directly at Endermen.
- Hostile mob proximity in view (based on distance)?
- Full moon increases fear gain rate if sky is visible.
- Armor value reduces fear gain rate.
- <50% Hunger fear gain faster as hunger bar is lower.

Fear reduced by:
- Defeating hostile mobs
- Staying in light.  Torch/glowstone max reduction to 20%.  Sunlight only way to reduce to 0%.
- Tamed dogs reduce fear.  Ex: 0.5% per second per dog, max 3 dogs.
- Proximity of villagers (distance and number). 

Fear effects (cumulative):
- 0-50 = nothing
- 51-60 = audio halucinations
- 61-70 = visual halucinations.
- 71-80 = start damage reduction, mining efficiency loss.  Decrease from 71-95.  At 95% no mining and minimal damage.
- 81-90 = dizzy effect
- 91-100 = confusion: random mapping movement (wasd) keys
